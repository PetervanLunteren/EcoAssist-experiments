@REM ### Placeholder script to open EcoAssist from inside Timelapse
@REM ### This batch script is redundant since Timelapse can also open it by executing the python command directly,
@REM ### but it is still here so that it mimics the old method. In the old method we needed this batch script to
@REM ### perform some conda operations before opening the python script. With the Jan 2025 install update 
@REM ### that is not neccesary anymore. But this script is still here so that Timelapse can run the same command as
@REM ### before and users don't have to update their timelapse version when using a new EcoAssist version.
